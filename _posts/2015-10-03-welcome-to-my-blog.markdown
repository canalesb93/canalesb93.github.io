Hey, if you've ever been to my portofolio before you'll noticed it's changed. I ran out of credit for my DigitalOcean server so I changed to a free alternative.

There's nothing here yet. Hopefully with time I'll add some projects I've worked on with information as to how I've faced problems with them as well as interesting code snippets. Also random stuff like how I prepared for technical interviews.

Snippets may look like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

This is really just for me to remember :).
